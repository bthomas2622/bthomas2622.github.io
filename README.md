### Nanodegree Curriculum 

* create a professional portfolio using HTML and the Bootstrap CSS framework

* develop your very own arcade game in JavaScript with the HTML5 Canvas API
* discover how to optimize your application’s perceived load time by taking the Critical Rendering Path into account

* explore best practices in application architecture and design patterns
* build a complex mapping application using the Knockout framework and a variety of third-party API services
* develop and maintain applications with the confidence test-driven development promotes, using the Jasmine testing framework
