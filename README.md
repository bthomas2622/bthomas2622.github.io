Ben Thomas Front End Web Dev Project Portfolio
===============================

This portolio is a mix projects I completed for my Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree certification and personal projects.

# **Nanodegree Program Summary**

Learn the fundamentals of how the web works and gain a working knowledge of the three foundational languages that power each and every website: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This Nanodegree will provide a guided, efficient path for you to learn to build beautiful, responsive websites optimized for security and performance.  

## Nanodegree Curriculum
