# Save the Penguin!

This project is a arcade game clone to demonstrate a knowledge of object oriented programming. 
Included in this projects are examples of function objects, psuedoclasses, use of constructors, and 
several other uses of javascript. 

All of this is built upon a HTML5 Canvas game engine provided by Udacity for the purposes of 
completing this project.

### Contributing

The links in this file should be [relative links](http://compugoddess.com/relative-vs-absolute-links/)
so that they will still work if the repository is forked.  View the [language.md](language.md)
file for an example of relative links.  (Click the "Raw" button to view the text that creates the
links.)  You can also use `..` to refer to the parent of the current directory if necessary.

### References

Please keep all lines to 120 characters or fewer.  Otherwise, the raw files
will be difficult to read in the browser or on the command line, and changes
will be harder to review.

### Contact Me

Insert blank lines between different options so that the options will be
visually separated.
